# Improvement Recommendations

## 1. Missing Task Breakdowns

**Current State**: We have detailed task breakdowns for Sprint 1 stories (PLCS-001 to PLCS-003) but not for:
- PLCS-004: API Client (8 points)
- PLCS-005: Service Layer (5 points)  
- PLCS-006: MCP Tool (5 points)
- All Sprint 2-5 stories

**Recommendation**: Create task breakdown documents for remaining stories before execution.

## 2. Dependencies Not Explicitly Mapped

**Current State**: Dependencies are implied but not explicitly documented.

**Recommendation**: Add a dependency graph:
```
PLCS-001 (Config) → PLCS-004 (API Client)
PLCS-002 (Models) → PLCS-004 (API Client)
PLCS-003 (Interfaces) → PLCS-004 (API Client)
PLCS-004 (API Client) → PLCS-005 (Service)
PLCS-005 (Service) → PLCS-006 (MCP Tool)
```

## 3. Test Infrastructure Story Missing

**Current State**: Test infrastructure is mentioned in parallel execution but has no GitHub issue.

**Recommendation**: Create PLCS-032 for test infrastructure setup as part of Sprint 1.

## 4. No Error Budget or Quality Gates

**Current State**: We have >80% coverage requirement but no other quality metrics.

**Recommendation**: Add quality gates:
- Max cyclomatic complexity: 10
- Type coverage: 100% (strict mypy)
- Performance benchmarks per endpoint
- Security scan requirements

## 5. Missing API Contract/Schema Definitions

**Current State**: No OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications.

**Recommendation**: Add PLCS-033 to create API contracts in Sprint 1, enabling:
- Contract-first development
- Auto-generated client code
- Better parallel development

## 6. No Feature Flags Strategy

**Current State**: All features are always on.

**Recommendation**: Add feature flag support for:
- Progressive rollout
- A/B testing capabilities
- Quick rollback options

## 7. Missing Observability Story in Early Sprints

**Current State**: Monitoring only comes in Sprint 5.

**Recommendation**: Add basic observability in Sprint 2:
- Request/response logging
- Basic metrics collection
- Error tracking

## 8. No Performance Baseline

**Current State**: No baseline metrics defined.

**Recommendation**: Add performance requirements:
- Search: <500ms uncached, <50ms cached
- Details: <300ms uncached, <30ms cached
- Autocomplete: <100ms
- 99th percentile targets

## 9. Missing Integration Points Documentation

**Current State**: MCP integration details are light.

**Recommendation**: Document:
- How tools connect to Claude/other LLMs
- Context window optimization
- Token usage optimization
- Error message formatting for LLMs

## 10. No Rollback Strategy

**Current State**: No documented rollback procedures.

**Recommendation**: Add:
- Database migration rollback
- API version deprecation strategy
- Backward compatibility requirements

## Priority Improvements

### Must Have Before Sprint 1:
1. Create remaining task breakdowns for PLCS-004, 005, 006
2. Add test infrastructure story
3. Define performance baselines

### Should Have Before Sprint 2:
1. Add basic observability story
2. Create API contract story
3. Document integration patterns

### Nice to Have:
1. Feature flags strategy
2. Enhanced quality gates
3. Rollback procedures

## Implementation Impact

These improvements would:
- Enable better parallel execution
- Reduce integration issues
- Improve quality from the start
- Make the system more maintainable

## Recommended New Stories

### PLCS-032: Test Infrastructure Setup (Sprint 1)
- pytest configuration
- Coverage setup
- Test fixtures
- CI/CD pipeline
- 3 story points

### PLCS-033: API Contract Definitions (Sprint 1)
- OpenAPI specification
- MCP protocol documentation
- Schema validation
- 2 story points

### PLCS-034: Basic Observability (Sprint 2)
- Request logging
- Basic metrics
- Error tracking
- 3 story points

This would bring Sprint 1 to 33 points (still manageable) while significantly improving project quality.
