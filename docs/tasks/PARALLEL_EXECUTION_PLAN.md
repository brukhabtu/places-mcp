## Synchronization Point 2
**Check PLCS-004 and PLCS-005 PRs are merged**

## Phase 3: Presentation
**Time: 1 hour**
**Stories: PLCS-006**

### Agent 7: MCP Tool (PLCS-006)
```
Todo Tracking:
1. [ ] Setup FastMCP server
2. [ ] Write tool tests (TDD)
3. [ ] Implement search_places tool
4. [ ] Add input validation
5. [ ] Add progress reporting
6. [ ] Wire up dependencies
7. [ ] Test with mock service
8. [ ] E2E test
9. [ ] Create PR
Total: 5 story points
```

## Execution Timeline

```
Hour 0-1: Agents 1-4 start simultaneously
         - Project setup
         - TDD test writing
         - Initial implementations

Hour 1-2: Agents 1-4 continue
         - Complete implementations
         - Run tests
         - Fix issues

Hour 2-3: Agents 1-4 finish
         - Create PRs
         - Merge to main
         
Hour 3-4: Agents 5-6 start
         - Infrastructure and service
         - TDD approach
         
Hour 4-5: Agents 5-6 continue
         - Complete implementations
         - Integration tests
         
Hour 5-6: Agents 5-6 finish, Agent 7 starts
         - Merge infrastructure/service
         - Start MCP tool
         
Hour 6-7: Agent 7 completes
         - Final integration
         - Sprint 1 complete!
```

## Success Metrics

### Per Agent
- [ ] All todos completed
- [ ] Tests written first (TDD)
- [ ] >90% test coverage
- [ ] PR created and passed CI
- [ ] Issue auto-closed

### Sprint Level
- [ ] All 6 stories complete
- [ ] 28 story points delivered
- [ ] Working MCP server
- [ ] Can search for places
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Parallel Safety Rules

### Can Run in Parallel
- Configuration + Domain + Interfaces
- Infrastructure + Application
- Any stories in different layers

### Must Run Sequentially
- Infrastructure → Presentation
- Application → Presentation
- Interfaces → Infrastructure

## Task Agent Communication

Each agent works independently but:
1. Reads from shared GitHub issues
2. Creates PRs that reference issues
3. Follows established patterns
4. Uses agreed interfaces

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **7x Faster**: 7 hours of work in 1 hour
2. **Quality**: TDD ensures correctness
3. **Progress**: Todo lists track everything
4. **Independence**: Agents don't block each other
5. **Integration**: Clean interfaces ensure compatibility
