# AI-Driven Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines how Claude Code will execute the agile plan autonomously, implementing each sprint's deliverables.

## Workflow Process

### 1. Sprint Execution Pattern

For each sprint, Claude Code will:

1. **Review Sprint Goals**
   - Read sprint requirements from GitHub issues
   - Understand acceptance criteria
   - Check dependencies between stories

2. **Implement Layer by Layer**
   - Start with lowest dependencies (Configuration/Domain)
   - Progress to Infrastructure → Application → Presentation
   - Ensure each layer is tested before moving up

3. **Automatic Progress Tracking**
   - Create feature branches for each story
   - Implement code with tests
   - Create PRs that reference issues
   - Auto-close issues when PRs merge

### 2. Implementation Order

#### Sprint 1 Implementation Sequence
```
1. PLCS-001 (Configuration) → Sets up project foundation
2. PLCS-003 (Domain) → Defines interfaces  
3. PLCS-002 (Domain) → Implements models
4. PLCS-004 (Infrastructure) → API client
5. PLCS-005 (Application) → Service layer
6. PLCS-006 (Presentation) → MCP tool
```

### 3. Automated Workflow Commands

```bash
# Start working on a story
gh issue view PLCS-001  # Read requirements
git checkout -b feature/PLCS-001-configuration

# After implementation
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(config): implement environment configuration

- Add Settings model with Pydantic
- Support GOOGLE_API_KEY validation  
- Load from .env files
- Add comprehensive tests

Closes #1"

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat(config): PLCS-001 environment configuration" \
  --body "Implements basic configuration management as per story requirements" \
  --label "Sprint 1,layer: configuration"

# Auto-merge when tests pass
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

### 4. Sprint Completion Checklist

For each sprint, Claude Code will:

- [ ] Implement all stories in dependency order
- [ ] Ensure >80% test coverage per component
- [ ] Create PRs that reference and close issues
- [ ] Update documentation as part of implementation
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Create sprint summary with working demo

## Benefits of AI Implementation

1. **Consistent Code Quality**: Every implementation follows the same patterns
2. **Complete Test Coverage**: Tests written alongside code
3. **Documentation**: Always up-to-date as part of implementation
4. **No Context Switching**: Can implement entire layers at once
5. **24/7 Development**: No delays between tasks

## GitHub Automation for AI Development

### Issue Auto-Close
PRs will use keywords to auto-close issues:
- `Closes #N`
- `Fixes #N`
- `Resolves #N`

### PR Auto-Merge
When all checks pass, PRs can auto-merge:
```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

### Progress Tracking
View sprint progress:
```bash
# See completed stories
gh issue list --milestone "Sprint 1: MVP Foundation" --state closed

# See remaining work
gh issue list --milestone "Sprint 1: MVP Foundation" --state open

# Check implementation status
gh pr list --label "Sprint 1"
```

## Implementation Commands by Sprint

### Sprint 1 Commands
```bash
# Create all implementation branches
for story in 001 002 003 004 005 006; do
  git checkout -b feature/PLCS-${story}
  git checkout main
done

# Work through each story
git checkout feature/PLCS-001
# ... implement configuration layer
gh pr create --fill

git checkout feature/PLCS-002  
# ... implement domain models
gh pr create --fill
```

### Automated Testing
Each PR will automatically run:
1. Unit tests via pytest
2. Coverage check (>80%)
3. Linting with ruff
4. Type checking with mypy

## Sprint Deliverables

### What Claude Code Will Deliver Each Sprint

#### Sprint 1 Deliverable
```bash
# Working MCP server that can:
python -m places_mcp search "pizza in new york"
# Returns structured JSON with place results
```

#### Sprint 2 Deliverable
```bash
# Enhanced server with:
python -m places_mcp details <place_id>
python -m places_mcp nearby --lat 40.7 --lng -74.0 --type restaurant
```

#### Sprint 3 Deliverable
```bash
# Optimized server showing:
- Response time <200ms for cached queries
- Rate limiting active
- Autocomplete working
```

#### Sprint 4 Deliverable
```bash
# Advanced search:
python -m places_mcp search "vegan restaurants" \
  --budget moderate \
  --open-now \
  --min-rating 4.0
```

#### Sprint 5 Deliverable
```bash
# Production deployment:
docker run places-mcp
kubectl apply -f k8s/
# Full monitoring dashboard active
```

## Success Metrics

Claude Code's implementation will be measured by:

1. **Functional**: All acceptance criteria met
2. **Quality**: >80% test coverage
3. **Performance**: Meets response time targets
4. **Documentation**: Complete and accurate
5. **Automation**: CI/CD fully operational

## No Human Intervention Needed

The beauty of AI implementation:
- No meetings required
- No status updates needed  
- No blockers from communication
- Just pure implementation

Claude Code will work through the backlog systematically, creating high-quality, tested code that meets all requirements.
